        Welcome to my website!
    </h1>

    <h2>
        About me:
    </h2><br>

    <p id="aboutme">
       I'm a 3rd year Computer Science and Software Engineering major. I've got a fair bit of experience with some programming languages:
       <br>
       I've made programs using Java, C#, C, Python, Typescript, and as you can see before you, HTML, CSS and Javascript!
       <br>
       I've also learned some C++ and rust Rust, and I have some experience with PostgreSQL and MongoDB!
       <br>
       You can see about the projects I've published below!
    </p>



    <h2>
        But enough about me, here's some of my projects!
    </h2><br>

    <h2>Blackjack using Typescript and HTML! </h2>

    <a href="https://github.com/Seansyerwan/blackjackproject">
        <!--My styling for the projects is like this: title, image to bring attention towards project, then blurb describing it.-->
        <p id="project"><br>
            <img src="vegas.png"><br>
        In this project I translated the game of Blackjack to Typescript! The game is simple: Beat the dealer without going over 21.<br><br>
        
        Currently, it shows the players "cards", with the first card from the dealer being shown to them as well. 
        Players can draw, double down, or stand. 

        The player also starts up with a number of chips, which can be either gained, or lost via playing. 
        If you run out of chips, that's game over! Though, you can always restart the page.<br>


        Hopefully you can have a blast with it! You can check out the github page by clicking anywhere in this box!

    <h2>Trivia!</h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/Seansyerwan/Trivia-Game">
        <p id="project">
            <br>
        <img src="trivia.png"><br>
        Wanna test your general knowledge skills? Why not give my game a spin!<br>

        Within the game itself you can choose from a list of ten different topics, with 5 questions from it, 
        and the game continues til you wish to end it. Feel free to let me know any suggestions you might have for a topic!<br>
        If you wanna give it a try, make sure to click on this box!

    <h2>Taxes! Sorta!</h2>

    <a href="https://github.com/Seansyerwan/python_tax_calc"><p id="project">
        There are two certainties in life: death and taxes. This program can help with hypotheticals for the latter!
        <br><img src ="taxes.png"><br>
        Were you ever curious about how much you'd be taxed on a wage of €1,000,000 per year? What about €1,000,000,000? Well this program can help!<br><br>
        Simply just input the income, tax credits and choose the social insurance group you (hypothetically would) belong to, 
        and the program will not only print out the data, but it also saves a formatted csv file to the directory you save the files in!<br><br>

    <h2>A small portfolio project using C!</h2>

    <a href="https://github.com/Seansyerwan/portfolio-terminal-in-C"><p id="project">
        Portfolios! It's a good way to summarise yourself, and this project can help you make a brief one! <br>

        The way this program works is simple: you input the data that's requested, and if eligible (>15), you will get a txt file written for you!<br><br>

        Once again, click somewhere in this box to access it.

    <a href="https://github.com/Seansyerwan/MinecraftBreedingResourceCalculator"><p id="project">
        Want to help optimise your playthrough of Minecraft? This calculator could help!<br>

        When playing through Minecraft, you may want to farm animals. However, you may need to consider how many resources it could take.
        Be it seeds for chickens or wheat for cows, or even time, it could take a while! So this program is here to help you plan 
        around this. Simply put in the amount of animals you have, and then say how many you wish to get, and it does the calculations for you!<br><br>

        And as usual, make sure to click in this box to get the GitHub page.
