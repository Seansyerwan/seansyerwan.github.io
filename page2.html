        <h2>Student Senate!</h2>
        <p id="irl">
            Since 2022, I've been an active member of the Student Senate on campus! This involves Student Senators (like myself) meeting monthly, discussing 
            affairs concerning the students union (like officer reports, reports from the Union of Students Ireland), discussing proposals, and 
            getting to collaborate, draft, and propose motions to vote on! 
            <br>
            I've passed multiple motions, working on several, and continue to do so, with
            the hope of making a better campus for all students!
