        <h2>Student Senate!</h2>
        <p id="irl">
            Since 2022, I've been an active member of the Student Senate on campus! This involves Student Senators (like myself) meeting monthly, discussing 
            affairs concerning the students union (like officer reports, reports from the Union of Students Ireland), discussing proposals, and 
            getting to collaborate, draft, and propose motions to vote on! 
            <br><br>
            I've passed multiple motions, working on several, and continue to do so, with
            the hope of making a better campus for all students!
        </p>

        <h2>My time on the Games Society Committee!</h2>
        <p id="irl">
            Being in the committee for one of the biggest societies on campus was a fantastic experience. I got to meet loads of amazing folks, 
            help manage the LAN side of things for the society, run events, get equipment that the society needed, help make decisions for the years to come,
            and thats before even mentioning the organisation for Dominicon! <br><br>
            In total, we ended up raising 5000 euros for Threshold, a charity helping those 
            struggling with housing! It was by far one of the most fun experiences I could have had and I'll be forever grateful for the friends 
            I made during my time.   
        </p>

        <h2>My work with the Pride Society!</h2>
        <p id="irl">
            As the secretary from 2023-2024, it was my responsibility as a core member of the committee to help out where I could, but also to 
            take the minutes for meetings, organise them, upload and share them with ourselves, and to send out communications with external groups 
            when necessary<br><br>
            
            This turned out to be a really interesting experience as I was given the opportunity to represent the society with official meetings
            soon into my term, and throughout, keeping in touch with the Students Union and others, while also running events like the weekly coffee 
            mornings (where I would keep my love of tea up!) <br><br>

            As a group that was always so near and dear to me I've been honored to work for them, and as of May 2024, I was elected as the Support and Equality officer for 2024-2025, and I do hope to keep up the work for the society!
